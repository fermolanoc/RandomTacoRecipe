"""
    Program that creates a workbook with 3 random taco recipes based
    on the recipe info by accessing an API that generates a random recipe each time it is accessed
    Workbook will include a Title with a related Taco image, credits to the image author, the taco API and
    workbook creator --> myself
    Then, 3 recipes will be shown on workbook, each one will have a name which will be composed based on the 5 main
    ingredients that the recipe contains (seasoning, condiment, mixin, base layer and shell).
    Each main ingredient will have its own title, description and detailed recipe info/preparation

    After each recipe document will include a page break to organize the content and show the next recipe
    By running the program it'll generate a Workbook document named RandomTacos.docx which will include 3 different
    taco recipes each time it is ran.
